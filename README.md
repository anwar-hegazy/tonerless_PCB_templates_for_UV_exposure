# tonerless_PCB_templates_for_UV_exposure
A method for creating long life reusable templates for UV exposing PC Boards

Project page is on hackaday.io at https://hackaday.io/project/4565-tonerless-pcb-templates-for-uv-exposure

Templates for producing multiple copies of the same PCB. 

The templates should be able to be used indefinitely if cared for properly... Excellent if you need to make the same board(s) over and over again.... 
This design is made to conform to the UV Oven Project I am working on as well...

The UV Oven project is located on hackaday.io also at https://hackaday.io/project/3787-diy-uv-exposure-oven-for-pcb-etching-and-masks
